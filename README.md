# Python 100 Days Coding Challange:
## Topic: Machine Learning

Learning Objectives: Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks / Atom
 - Visualizing data: basic charts, time series, and statistical plots
 - Preparing for analysis: treating missing values and data transformation
 - Data analysis basics: arithmetic, summary statistics, and correlation analysis
 - Outlier analysis: univariate, multivariate, and linear projection methods
 - Introduction to machine learning
 - Basic machine learning methods: linear and logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes
 - Reducing dataset dimensionality with PCA
 - Clustering and classification: k-means, hierarchical, and k-NN
 - Simulating a social network with NetworkX
 - Creating Plot.ly charts
 - Scraping the web with Beautiful Soup

Day 1: Preparation, Collect Data, Install Python 3.7, Atom IDE
 - DataFrame objects 
   - Acts like a spreadsheet in Excel
   - Made up of a set of Series objects
   - Indexable
 - Series object is a single row or column that is indexed
 - Comparison Operators in Python
  - == True if values of two operands are equal
  - != True if values of two operands are unequal
  - <> True if values of two operands are unequal
  - >  True if the left operand has a value that's greater than the right operand
  - <  True if the left operand has a value that's less than the right operand
  - >=  True if the left operand has a value that's greater than or equal to the right
  - <=  True if the left operand has a value that's less than or equal to the right
